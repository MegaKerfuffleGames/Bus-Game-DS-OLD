# Bus Game Dedicated Server (removed as of v0.8)
The dedicated server for the old multiplayer dedicated server in Bus Game. It's based on [Tom Weiland's C# Networking tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh8XaC0Y5MA) ([GitHub repo here](https://github.com/tom-weiland/tcp-udp-networking/tree/master)) and honestly hasn't been modified too much from Tom's original code. This implementation has been removed as of pre-alpha v0.8 and is being replaced with an implementation based on Unity's Netcode for GameObjects package (with code that I'm actually writing, for better or worse).

Full credit goes to Tom for the bulk of the code in this repo. I highly recommend checking out his new [Riptide Networking solution](https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideNetworking) if you're looking for a lightweight networking solution for Unity/C#.
